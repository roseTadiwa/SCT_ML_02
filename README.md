# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

In this project, I applied the K-means clustering algorithm to analyze the mall_customers.csv dataset, which contains purchase history data from a retail store.
By preprocessing the data and extracting key features, I grouped customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behaviors.
This analysis helps in understanding customer demographics and enhances targeted marketing strategies. 
The implementation and results are available in this repository, demonstrating the practical use of machine learning techniques for customer analytics.
